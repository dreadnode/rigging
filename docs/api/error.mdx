{/*
::: rigging.error
*/}

We try to avoid creating custom exceptions unless they are necessary.

We use the built-in and pydantic exceptions as much as possible.

CompletionExhaustedMaxRoundsError
---------------------------------

```python
CompletionExhaustedMaxRoundsError(
    max_rounds: int, completion: str
)
```

Raised when the maximum number of rounds is exceeded while generating completions.

<Accordion title="Source code in rigging/error.py" icon="code">
```python
def __init__(self, max_rounds: int, completion: str):
    super().__init__(max_rounds)
    self.completion = completion
    """The completion which was being generated when the exception occurred."""
```


</Accordion>

### completion

```python
completion = completion
```

The completion which was being generated when the exception occurred.

ExhaustedMaxRoundsError
-----------------------

```python
ExhaustedMaxRoundsError(max_rounds: int)
```

Raised when the maximum number of rounds is exceeded while generating.

<Accordion title="Source code in rigging/error.py" icon="code">
```python
def __init__(self, max_rounds: int):
    super().__init__(f"Exhausted max rounds ({max_rounds}) while generating")
    self.max_rounds = max_rounds
    """The number of rounds which was exceeded."""
```


</Accordion>

### max\_rounds

```python
max_rounds = max_rounds
```

The number of rounds which was exceeded.

InvalidGeneratorError
---------------------

```python
InvalidGeneratorError(model: str)
```

Raised when an invalid identifier is specified when getting a generator.

<Accordion title="Source code in rigging/error.py" icon="code">
```python
def __init__(self, model: str):
    super().__init__(f"Invalid model specified: {model}")
```


</Accordion>

InvalidTokenizerError
---------------------

```python
InvalidTokenizerError(tokenizer: str)
```

Raised when an invalid tokenizer is specified.

<Accordion title="Source code in rigging/error.py" icon="code">
```python
def __init__(self, tokenizer: str):
    super().__init__(f"Invalid tokenizer specified: {tokenizer}")
    self.tokenizer = tokenizer
    """The name of the tokenizer which was invalid."""
```


</Accordion>

### tokenizer

```python
tokenizer = tokenizer
```

The name of the tokenizer which was invalid.

MaxDepthError
-------------

```python
MaxDepthError(
    max_depth: int, step: PipelineStep, reference: str
)
```

Raised when the maximum depth is exceeded while generating.

<Accordion title="Source code in rigging/error.py" icon="code">
```python
def __init__(self, max_depth: int, step: "PipelineStep", reference: str):
    super().__init__(f"Exceeded max depth ({max_depth}) while generating ('{reference}')")
    self.max_depth = max_depth
    """The maximum depth of nested pipeline generations which was exceeded."""
    self.step = step
    """The pipeline step which cause the depth error."""
```


</Accordion>

### max\_depth

```python
max_depth = max_depth
```

The maximum depth of nested pipeline generations which was exceeded.

### step

```python
step = step
```

The pipeline step which cause the depth error.

MessageWarning
--------------

Base class for all message warnings.

This is used to indicate that something unexpected happened during the message processing,
but it is not critical enough to stop the execution.

MessagesExhaustedMaxRoundsError
-------------------------------

```python
MessagesExhaustedMaxRoundsError(
    max_rounds: int, messages: list[Message]
)
```

Raised when the maximum number of rounds is exceeded while generating messages.

<Accordion title="Source code in rigging/error.py" icon="code">
```python
def __init__(self, max_rounds: int, messages: list["Message"]):
    super().__init__(max_rounds)
    self.messages = messages
    """The messages which were being generated when the exception occurred."""
```


</Accordion>

### messages

```python
messages = messages
```

The messages which were being generated when the exception occurred.

MissingModelError
-----------------

```python
MissingModelError(content: str)
```

Raised when a model is missing when parsing a message.

<Accordion title="Source code in rigging/error.py" icon="code">
```python
def __init__(self, content: str):
    super().__init__(content)
```


</Accordion>

PipelineWarning
---------------

Base class for all pipeline warnings.

This is used to indicate that something unexpected happened during the pipeline execution,
but it is not critical enough to stop the execution.

ProcessingError
---------------

```python
ProcessingError(content: str)
```

Raised when an error occurs during internal generator processing.

<Accordion title="Source code in rigging/error.py" icon="code">
```python
def __init__(self, content: str):
    super().__init__(content)
```


</Accordion>

Stop
----

```python
Stop(message: str)
```

Raise inside a pipeline to indicate a stopping condition.

Example

```python
import rigging as rg

async def read_file(path: str) -> str:
    "Read the contents of a file."

    if no_more_files(path):
        raise rg.Stop("There are no more files to read.")

    ...

chat = await pipeline.using(read_file).run()
```


<Accordion title="Source code in rigging/error.py" icon="code">
```python
def __init__(self, message: str):
    super().__init__(message)
    self.message = message
    """The message associated with the stop."""
```


</Accordion>

### message

```python
message = message
```

The message associated with the stop.

TokenizerWarning
----------------

Base class for all tokenization warnings.

This is used to indicate that something unexpected happened during the tokenization process,
but it is not critical enough to stop the execution.

ToolDefinitionError
-------------------

```python
ToolDefinitionError(message: str)
```

Raised when a tool cannot be properly defined.

<Accordion title="Source code in rigging/error.py" icon="code">
```python
def __init__(self, message: str):
    super().__init__(message)
```


</Accordion>

ToolWarning
-----------

Base class for all tool warnings.

This is used to indicate that something unexpected happened during the tool execution,
but it is not critical enough to stop the execution.

UnknownToolError
----------------

```python
UnknownToolError(tool_name: str)
```

Raised when the an api tool call is made for an unknown tool.

<Accordion title="Source code in rigging/error.py" icon="code">
```python
def __init__(self, tool_name: str):
    super().__init__(f"Unknown tool call was requested for '{tool_name}'")
    self.tool_name = tool_name
    """The name of the tool which was unknown."""
```


</Accordion>

### tool\_name

```python
tool_name = tool_name
```

The name of the tool which was unknown.

raise\_as
---------

```python
raise_as(
    error_type: type[Exception], message: str
) -> t.Callable[[t.Callable[P, R]], t.Callable[P, R]]
```

When the wrapped function raises an exception, `raise ... from` with the new error type.

<Accordion title="Source code in rigging/error.py" icon="code">
```python
def raise_as(
    error_type: type[Exception],
    message: str,
) -> t.Callable[[t.Callable[P, R]], t.Callable[P, R]]:
    "When the wrapped function raises an exception, `raise ... from` with the new error type."

    def _raise_as(func: t.Callable[P, R]) -> t.Callable[P, R]:
        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args: P.args, **kwargs: P.kwargs) -> R:
            try:
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            except Exception as e:
                error = error_type(message)
                raise error from e

        if wrapper.__doc__ is None:
            wrapper.__doc__ = ""

        wrapper.__doc__ += f"\n\nRaises:\n    {error_type.__name__}{': ' + message}"

        return wrapper

    return _raise_as
