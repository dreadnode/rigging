We publish every version to Pypi:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install -U rigging
```

```bash uv
uv pip install -U rigging
```

```bash poetry
poetry add rigging
```
</CodeGroup>

If you want all the extras (vLLM, transformers, examples), specify the `all` extra:

<CodeGroup>
```bash pip
pip install -U rigging[all]
```

```bash uv
uv pip install -U rigging[all]
```

```bash poetry
poetry add rigging[all]
```
</CodeGroup>

If you want to build from source:

```bash
cd rigging/
poetry install
```
