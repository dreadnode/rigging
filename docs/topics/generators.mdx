Underlying LLMs (or any function which completes text) is represented as a generator in Rigging. They are typically instantiated using identifier strings and the `get_generator` function. The base interface is flexible, and designed to support optimizations should the underlying mechanisms support it (batching async, K/V cache, etc.)

## Identifiers

Much like database connection strings, Rigging generators can be represented as strings which define what provider, model, API key, generation params, etc should be used. They are formatted as follows:

```
<provider>!<model>,<**kwargs>
```

- `provider` maps to a particular subclass of `Generator`.
- `model` is a any `str` value, typically used by the provider to indicate a specific LLM to target.
- `kwargs` are used to carry:
    1. API key (`,api_key=...`) or the base URL (`,api_base=...`) for the model provider.
    1. Serialized `GenerateParams`fields like like temp, stop tokens, etc.
    1. Additional provider-specific attributes to set on the constructed generator class. For instance, you
    can set the `LiteLLMGenerator.max_connections`property by passing `,max_connections=` in the identifier string.

The provider is optional and Rigging will fallback to  [`litellm`](https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm)/`LiteLLMGenerator` by default.
You can view the [LiteLLM docs](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/) for more information about supported model providers and parameters.

<Note>
Throughout our code, we frequently use these generator identifiers as CLI arguments, environment variables, and API parameters. They work like database connection strings and are super convenient for passing around complex configurations. They are also used to serialize generators to storage, so you can save and load them easily.
</Note>

Here are some examples of valid identifiers:

```text
gpt-3.5-turbo,temperature=0.5
openai/gpt-4,api_key=sk-1234
litellm!claude-3-sonnet-2024022
anthropic/claude-2.1,stop=output:;---,seed=1337
together_ai/meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf
openai/google/gemma-7b,api_base=https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1
```

Building generators from string identifiers is optional, but a convenient way to represent complex LLM configurations.

<Tip>
**Back to Strings**

Any generator can be converted back into an identifier using either `to_identifier` or `get_identifier`.

```python
generator = rg.get_generator("gpt-3.5-turbo,temperature=0.5")
print(generator.to_identifier())
# litellm!gpt-3.5-turbo,temperature=0.5
```
</Tip>

## API Keys

All generators carry a `.api_key` attribute which can be set directly, or by passing `,api_key=` as part of an identifier string. Not all generators will require one, but they are common enough that we include the attribute as part of the base class.

Typically you will be using a library like LiteLLM underneath, and can simply use environment variables:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=...
export TOGETHER_API_KEY=...
export TOGETHERAI_API_KEY=...
export MISTRAL_API_KEY=...
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=...
```

## Rate Limits

Generators that leverage remote services (LiteLLM) expose properties for managing connection/request limits:

- `LiteLLMGenerator.max_connections`
- `LiteLLMGenerator.min_delay_between_requests`

However, a more flexible solution is `ChatPipeline.wrap()` with a library like [**backoff**](https://github.com/litl/backoff) to catch many, or specific errors, like rate limits or general connection issues.

```python
import rigging as rg

import backoff
import backoff.types

def on_backoff(details: backoff.types.Details) -> None:
    print(f"Backing off {details['wait']:.2f}s")

pipeline = (
    rg.get_generator("claude-3-haiku-20240307")
    .chat("Give me a 4 word phrase about machines.")
    .wrap(
        backoff.on_exception(
            backoff.expo,
            Exception,  # This should be scoped down
            on_backoff=on_backoff,
        )
    )
)

chats = await pipeline.run_many(50)
```

<Note>
You'll find that the exception consistency inside LiteLLM can be quite poor. Different providers throw different types of exceptions for all kinds of status codes, response data, etc. With that said, you can typically find a target list that works well for your use-case.
</Note>

## Local Models

We have experimental support for both [`vLLM`](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/) and [`transformers`](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) generators for loading and running models **directly in the same Python process**. In general vLLM is more consistent with Rigging's preferred API, but the dependency requirements are heavier.

Where needed, you can wrap an existing model into a rigging generator by using the `VLLMGenerator.from_obj()` or `TransformersGenerator.from_obj()` methods. These are helpful for any picky model construction that might not play well with our rigging constructors.

<Note>
The use of these local generators requires the `vllm` and `transformers` packages to be installed. You can use `rigging[all]` to install them all at once, or pick your preferred package individually.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```python Auto Construction
import rigging as rg

tiny_llama = rg.get_generator(
    "vllm!TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0," \
    "gpu_memory_utilization=0.3," \
    "trust_remote_code=True"
)

llama_3 = rg.get_generator(
    "transformers!meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct"
)
```

```python Manual Construction
import rigging as rg
import transformers as tf

model = tf.AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
    trust_remote_code=True,
)
tokenizer = tf.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(
    "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct",
    trust_remote_code=True,
)

llama_3 = rg.generator.TransformersGenerator.from_obj(
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
)
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
**Loading and Unloading**

You can use the `Generator.load` and `Generator.unload` methods to better control memory usage. Local providers typically are lazy and load the model into memory only when first needed.
</Tip>

## Self-Hosted Models

In addition to loading models directly inside the Python process, you often want to access models via some self-hosted server like [**Ollama**](https://ollama.com/) or [**vLLM**](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/). Using self-hosted models is well supported in the LiteLLM ecosystem, and usually just requires some consideration for the API base URL and API key. Beyond specific servers, many services expose models in the "openai-compatible" format, which can be used with the `openai/` LiteLLM prefix (usually just `openai/<model>,api_base=http://...,api_key=...`).

- https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/vllm
- https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/ollama
- https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/openai_compatible

### Self-Hosted Ollama

We'll load the `qwen3:0.6b` model from Ollama, and the ollama server will host the model on `http://localhost:11434` by default.

```bash
$ ollama run qwen3:0.6b
...

$ ollama ps                                                                                                                       docker-desktop
NAME          ID              SIZE      PROCESSOR    UNTIL
qwen3:0.6b    7df6b6e09427    2.3 GB    100% GPU     4 minutes from now
```

Using this model in Rigging is as simple as using the `ollama/` or `ollama_chat/` prefixes:

```python
import rigging as rg

qwen = rg.get_generator("ollama/qwen3:0.6b")

chat = await qwen.chat("Hello!").run()
print(chat.conversation)

# [user]: Hello!

# [assistant]: <think>
# Okay, the user said "Hello!" so I need to respond appropriately. Let me start by acknowledging their greeting.
# A simple "Hello!" is good, but maybe add a friendly note to make it more engaging. I should keep it short and positive.
# Let me check if there's any specific context I should consider, but since there's no additional info, just a standard
# greeting should work. Make sure the response is welcoming and open-ended.
# </think>

# Hello! How can I assist you today? 😊
```

<Note>
If you are running the Ollama server somewhere besides localhost, just pass the `api_base` to the generator:

```python
qwen = rg.get_generator(
  "ollama/qwen3:0.6b,api_base=http://remote-server:11434"
)
```
</Note>

### Self-Hosted vLLM Server

vLLM ships with it's own [openai-compatible server](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/openai_compatible_server.html) using the `vllm serve` command. LiteLLM uses the `hosted_vllm/` prefix to connect there, otherwise you can use the `openai/` prefix noted below.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Direct
$ vllm serve --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
```

```bash Docker
$ docker run --runtime nvidia --gpus all \
    -v ~/.cache/huggingface:/root/.cache/huggingface \
    -p 8000:8000 \
    vllm/vllm-openai \
    --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B
```
</CodeGroup>

Rigging can now use the vLLM model for Chat or Completions:

```python
import rigging as rg

qwen = rg.get_generator("hosted_vllm/Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B,api_base=http://<server>:8000/v1")

chat = await qwen.chat("Hello!").run()
print(chat.conversation)

# [user]: Hello!

# [assistant]: <think>
# Okay, the user said "Hello!" so I need to respond appropriately. Let me start by acknowledging their greeting.
# A simple "Hello!" is good, but maybe add a friendly note to make it more engaging. I should keep it short and positive.
# Let me check if there's any specific context I should consider, but since there's no additional info, just a standard
# greeting should work. Make sure the response is welcoming and open-ended.
# </think>

# Hello! How can I assist you today? 😊
```

### Self-Hosted OpenAI-Compatible Server

For most other self-hosted models, the server will expose OpenAI-compatible endpoints, and you can use the `openai/` prefix for LiteLLM as noted in [their docs](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers/openai_compatible):

<Info>
Selecting openai as the provider routes your request to an OpenAI-compatible endpoint using the upstream official OpenAI Python API library.

This library requires an API key for all requests, either through the api_key parameter or the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable.

If you don't want to provide a fake API key in each request, consider using a provider that directly matches your OpenAI-compatible endpoint, such as `hosted_vllm` or `llamafile`.
</Info>

```python
import rigging as rg

gen = rg.get_generator("openai/<model>,api_base=http://<server>/v1"

chat = await gen.chat("Hello").run()
print(chat.conversation)
```

<Note>
You can also use the `openai/` prefix along with `api_key=` and `api_base=` for vLLM:

```python
gen = rg.get_generator(
  "openai/<model>,api_base=http://localhost:8000/v1,api_key=sk-none"
)
```
</Note>

## Overload Generation Params

When working with both `CompletionPipeline` and `ChatPipeline`, you can overload and update any generation params by using the associated `.with_()` function.

<CodeGroup>
```python with_() as keyword arguments
import rigging as rg

pipeline = rg.get_generator("gpt-3.5-turbo,max_tokens=50").chat([
    {"role": "user", "content": "Say a haiku about boats"},
])

for temp in [0.1, 0.5, 1.0]:
    chat = await pipeline.with_(temperature=temp).run()
    print(chat.last.content)
```

```python with_() as GenerateParams
import rigging as rg

pipeline = rg.get_generator("gpt-3.5-turbo,max_tokens=50").chat([
    {"role": "user", "content": "Say a haiku about boats"},
])

for temp in [0.1, 0.5, 1.0]:
    chat = await pipeline.with_(rg.GenerateParams(temperature=temp)).run()
    print(chat.last.content)
```
</CodeGroup>

## HTTP Generator

The `HTTPGenerator` allows you to wrap any HTTP endpoint as a generator, making it easy to integrate external LLMs or AI services into your Rigging pipelines. It works by defining a specification that maps message content into HTTP requests and parses responses back into messages.

The specification is assigned to the `.spec` field on the generator, and can be applied as a Python dictionary, JSON string, YAML string, or base64 encoded JSON/YAML string.

This flexibility allows you to easily share and reuse specifications across different parts of your application.

```python
import rigging as rg

spec = r"""
request:
  url: "https://{{ model }}.platform.dreadnode.io/submit"
  headers:
    "X-Api-Key": "{{ api_key }}"
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
  transforms:
    - type: "json"
      pattern: {
        "data": "$content"
      }
response:
  transforms:
    - type: "jsonpath"
      pattern: $.flag,output,message
"""

crucible = rg.get_generator("http!spanglish,api_key=<key>") # (1)
crucible.spec = spec

chat = await crucible.chat("A flag please").run()

print(chat.conversation)
# [user]: A flag please
#
# [assistant]: Una bandera, por favor.
```

*1. Were are using the `.model` field on the generator to carry our crucible challenge*

<Tip>
**Saving schemas**

Encoded YAML is the default storage when an HTTP generator is serialized to an identifier using
`to_identifier`. This also means that when we save
our chats to storage, they maintain their http specification.

```py
print(crucible.to_identifier())
# http!spanglish,spec=eyJyZXF1ZXN0Ijp7InVyb...
```
</Tip>

### Specification

The specification (`HTTPSpec`) controls how messages are transformed around HTTP interactions. It supports:

- Template-based URLs
- Template-based header generation
- Configurable timeouts and HTTP methods
- Status code validation
- Flexible body transformations for both the request and response

When building requests, the following context variables (`RequestTransformContext`)
are available in your transform patterns:

- `role` - Role of the last message (user/assistant/system)
- `content` - Content of the last message
- `all_content` - Concatenated content of all messages
- `messages` - List of all message objects
- `params` - Generation parameters (temperature, max_tokens, etc.)
- `api_key` - API key from the generator
- `model` - Model identifier from the generator

For both request and response transform chains, the previous result of each transform is
provided to the next transform via any of `data`, `output`, `result`, or `body`.

### Transforms

The HTTP generator supports different types of transforms for both request building and response parsing.
Each serves a specific purpose and has its own pattern syntax.

<Tip>
**Transform Chaining**

Transforms are applied in sequence, with each transform's output becoming the input for the next.
This allows you to build complex processing pipelines:

```yaml
transforms:
    - type: "jsonpath"
    pattern: "$.data"  # Extract data object
    - type: "jinja"
    pattern: "{{ result | tojson }}"  # Convert to string
    - type: "regex"
    pattern: "message: (.*)"  # Extract specific field
```
</Tip>

**Jinja (request + response)**

The `jinja` transform type provides full Jinja2 template syntax. Access context variables directly
and use Jinja2 filters and control structures.

```yaml
transforms:
  - type: "jinja"
    pattern: >
      {
        "content": "{{ all_content }}",
        "timestamp": "{{ now() }}",
        {% if params.temperature > 0.5 %}
        "mode": "creative"
        {% endif %}
      }
```

**JSON (request only)**

The `json` transform type lets you build JSON request bodies using a template object. Use `$` prefix
to reference context variables, with dot notation for nested access:

```yaml
transforms:
  - type: "json"
    pattern: {
      "messages": "$messages",
      "temperature": "$params.temperature",
      "content": "$content",
      "static_field": "hello"
    }
```

**JSONPath (response only)**

The `jsonpath` transform type uses [JSONPath](https://github.com/h2non/jsonpath-ng) expressions to extract data from JSON responses:

```yaml
transforms:
  - type: "jsonpath"
    pattern: "$.choices[0].message.content"
```

**Regex (response only)**

The `regex` transform type uses regular expressions to extract content from text responses:

```yaml
transforms:
  - type: "regex"
    pattern: "<output>(.*?)</output>"
```

## Writing a Generator

All generators should inherit from the `Generator` base class, and can elect to implement handlers for messages and/or texts:

- `async def generate_messages(...)` - Used for `ChatPipeline.run` variants.
- `async def generate_texts(...)` - Used for `CompletionPipeline.run` variants.

<Note>
If your generator doesn't implement a particular method like text completions, Rigging will simply raise a `NotImplementedError` for you. It's currently undecided whether generators should prefer to provide weak overloads for compatibility, or whether they should ignore methods which can't be used optimally to help provide clarity to the user about capability. You'll find we've opted for the former strategy in our generators.
</Note>

Generators operate in a batch context by default, taking in groups of message lists or texts. Whether
your implementation takes advantage of this batching is up to you, but where possible you
should be optimizing as much as possible.

<Tip>
Generators don't make any assumptions about the underlying mechanism that completes text. You might use a local model, API endpoint, or static code, etc. The base class is designed to be flexible and support a wide variety of use cases. You'll find the inclusion of `api_key`, `model`, and generation params are common enough that they are included in the base class.
</Tip>

```python
from rigging import Generator, GenerateParams, Message, GeneratedMessage

class Custom(Generator):
    # model: str
    # api_key: str
    # params: GeneratorParams

    custom_field: bool

    async def generate_messages(
        self,
        messages: t.Sequence[t.Sequence[Message]],
        params: t.Sequence[GenerateParams],
    ) -> t.Sequence[GeneratedMessage]:
        # merge_with is an easy way to combine overloads
        params = [
            self.params.merge_with(p).to_dict() for p in params
        ]

        # Access self vars where needed
        api_key = self.api_key
        model_id = self.model
        custom = self.custom_field

        # Build output messages with stop reason, usage, etc.
        # output_messages = ...

        return output_messages


generator = Custom(model='foo', custom_field=True)
generator.chat(...)
```

<Tip>
Use the `register_generator` method to add your generator class under a custom providerid so it can be used with `get_generator`.

```python
import rigging as rg

rg.register_generator('custom', Custom)

custom = rg.get_generator('custom!foo,custom_field=True')
```
</Tip>
