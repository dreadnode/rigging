Tools in Rigging allow language models to interact with external systems, execute code, or perform well-defined tasks during generation. Rigging v3 introduces a **unified tool system**, making it easier to define tools and control how they interact with different language models.

For most uses, you can just build any function with type hints, and pass that into a pipeline:

```python
import rigging as rg

def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Adds two numbers together."""
    return a + b

chat = (
    await rg.get_generator("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
    .chat("What is 2 + 3?")
    .using(add_numbers) # Pass the function directly
    .run()
)
```

## Defining Tools

Rigging uses function signatures (type hints and docstrings) to automatically generate the necessary schema and description for the language model. If you'd like to make any modifications to your tool's name, description, or schema, you can use the `@tool` decorator and pass that into pipelines.

### Using `@tool` for Functions

Decorate any regular Python function (including static methods) with `@rigging.tool` to make it usable by the Rigging framework.

```python
import typing as t
from typing import Annotated
import rigging as rg
import requests

@rg.tool
def get_weather(city: Annotated[str, "The city name to get weather for"]) -> str:
    """Gets the current weather for a specified city."""
    try:
        city = city.replace(" ", "+")
        # Use a real weather API in practice
        return requests.get(f"http://wttr.in/{city}?format=3").text.strip()
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Failed to get weather: {e}"

# The 'get_weather' object is now a rigging.tool.Tool instance
print(get_weather.name)
# > get_weather
print(get_weather.description)
# > Gets the current weather for a specified city.
print(get_weather.parameters_schema)
# > {'type': 'object', 'properties': {'city': {'title': 'City', 'description': 'The city name to get weather for', 'type': 'string'}}, 'required': ['city']}
```

- Type hints are crucial for defining the parameters the model needs to provide.
- Use `typing.Annotated` to provide descriptions for parameters where needed.
- The function's docstring is used as the tool's description for the model.

### Using `@tool_method` for Class Methods

If your tool logic resides within a class and needs access to instance state (`self`), use the `@rigging.tool_method` decorator instead.

```python
import typing as t
from typing import Annotated
import rigging as rg

class UserProfileManager:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        self.api_key = api_key
        self._users = {"123": {"name": "Alice", "email": "alice@example.com"}} # Dummy data

    @rg.tool_method(name="fetch_user_profile") # Optional: override name
    def get_profile(self, user_id: Annotated[str, "The ID of the user to fetch"]) -> dict[str, t.Any] | str:
        """Retrieves a user's profile information using their ID."""
        # Use self.api_key etc. here
        profile = self._users.get(user_id)
        if profile:
            return profile
        return f"User with ID {user_id} not found."

# Instantiate the class
profile_manager = UserProfileManager(api_key="dummy_key")

# Access the tool method *through the instance*
user_profile_tool = profile_manager.get_profile

print(user_profile_tool.name)
# > fetch_user_profile
print(user_profile_tool.description)
# > Retrieves a user's profile information using their ID.
```

<Note>
`@tool_method` correctly handles the `self` argument, ensuring it's not included in the schema presented to the language model. Use `@tool` for static methods if they don't require `self`.
</Note>

### Underlying Mechanism

Both decorators use `Tool.from_callable()` internally to wrap your function/method into a `Tool` object. This object holds the function, its generated schema, name, and description.

### Async vs Sync

You can define your tools as either synchronous or asynchronous functions. Rigging will automatically handle the invocation based on the function's type. Usually it's good practice to use `async def` for all your tool functions, and you can opt into any asynchronous behavior later when you start to scale your pipelines.

```python
import rigging as rg

@rg.tool
async def afetch_data(url: str) -> dict:
    """Fetches data from a given URL (async)"""
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
        async with session.get(url) as response:
            return await response.json()

@rg.tool
def fetch_data(url: str) -> dict:
    """Fetches data from a given URL (sync)"""
    response = requests.get(url)
    return response.json()

data = await afetch_data("https://api.example.com/data")
data = fetch_data("https://api.example.com/data")

@rg.prompt(tools=[afetch_data, fetch_data])
def explore_api(url: str) -> rg.Chat:
    "Explore the API at the given URL"
    ...

chat = await explore_api("https://api.example.com/data")
```

## Using Tools in Pipelines

To make tools available during generation, pass them to the `ChatPipeline.using()` method.

```python
import rigging as rg

# Assume get_weather tool is defined as above
# Assume profile_manager.get_profile tool is defined and instantiated

chat = (
    await rg.get_generator("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
    .chat("What's the weather like in Paris, and what's Alice's email (user ID 123)?")
    .using(
        get_weather,                  # Pass the decorated function directly
        profile_manager.get_profile,  # Pass the bound method from the instance
        mode="auto",                  # Let Rigging choose the best invocation method (API or native)
        max_depth=5                   # Limit recursive tool calls (e.g., if a tool calls another prompt)
    )
    .run()
)

print(chat.conversation)
```

### Passing Class Instances Directly

You can also pass an entire class instance directly to `.using()`, and Rigging will automatically discover and include all methods decorated with `@tool_method`:

```python
import rigging as rg

class DatabaseTools:
    def __init__(self, connection_string: str):
        self.connection_string = connection_string

    @rg.tool_method
    def query_users(self, name_filter: str) -> list[dict]:
        """Query users from the database by name filter."""
        # Database query logic here
        return [{"id": 1, "name": "Alice"}, {"id": 2, "name": "Bob"}]

    @rg.tool_method
    def create_user(self, name: str, email: str) -> dict:
        """Create a new user in the database."""
        # User creation logic here
        return {"id": 3, "name": name, "email": email}

# Instantiate the class
db_tools = DatabaseTools("postgresql://localhost/mydb")

# Pass the instance directly - Rigging will find both tool methods
chat = (
    await rg.get_generator("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
    .chat("Find all users with 'Al' in their name, then create a new user named Charlie with email charlie@example.com")
    .using(db_tools)  # Pass the entire instance
    .run()
)
```

This is equivalent to passing each tool method individually:

```python
# These two approaches are equivalent:
.using(db_tools)  # Automatic discovery

.using(
    db_tools.query_users,
    db_tools.create_user
)  # Manual specification
```

<Note>
When you pass a class instance to `.using()`, Rigging uses Python's `inspect` module to discover all methods decorated with `@tool_method`. This automatic discovery only includes methods that have been properly decorated - regular methods without the `@tool_method` decorator will be ignored.
</Note>

### Tool Invocation Modes (`mode`)

The `mode` parameter in `.using()` controls how Rigging interacts with the language model for tool calls:

-  **`auto` (Default):** Rigging checks if the model provider supports API-level function calling (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). If yes, it uses that native, efficient mechanism. If not, it falls back to `xml`.
-  **`api`:** Forces the use of the provider's function calling API. Will fail if the provider doesn't support it.
-  **`xml`:** Rigging injects instructions and an XML schema into the prompt, telling the model how to format its output to request a tool call using specific XML tags. Rigging parses this XML.
-  **`json-in-xml`:** Similar to `xml`, but the model is instructed to place a JSON object containing the arguments within the XML tags.
-  **`json-with-tag`:** Similar to `json`, but the JSON object is wrapped in a specific tag (e.g., `<tool_call>`).
-  **`json`:** The model is instructed to output tool calls as raw JSON anywhere in the message content with `name` and `arguments` fields.
-  **`pythonic`:** The model is instructed to output tool calls as Python-style function calls in the message content.

Generally, `auto` is recommended as it leverages the most efficient method available.

### Controlling Recursion (`max_depth`)

The `max_depth` parameter limits how many levels deep tool calls can go. If a tool itself triggers another prompt that uses tools, this prevents infinite loops.

### Stopping Tool Calls

You may want to use a particular tool, or catch a condition inside a tool, and indicate to any pipelines that it should stop going back to the model for more calls. You can do this by raising or returning a `rigging.Stop` exception with a message to be passed back to the model for context.

```python
import rigging as rg

@rg.tool
def execute_code(code: str) -> str:
    "Finish a task and report a summary of work"
    ...

    if "<flag>" in output: # Stop the model from executing more code
        return rg.Stop(f"Task finished") # or `raise rg.Stop("Task finished")`

    return output

chat = (
    await rg.get_generator("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
    .chat("Work to accomplish <work>, then finish it.")
    .using(finish_task)
    .run()
)
```

<Tip>
Returning the `rg.Stop` exception instead of raising it is helpful if you don't want any surrounding code (decorators that wrap the tool function) to catch the exception, alter it, or behave as if a typical exception occurred.
</Tip>

<Note>
This stop indication won't completely halt the pipeline, but it will let it continue to any additional parsing mechanics or custom callbacks which follow tool calling.
</Note>

## MCP Integration (Model Context Protocol)

The [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://github.com/model-context-protocol/specification) is an open standard for language models to interact with external tools and services. Rigging provides a client to connect to MCP-compliant servers.

### Using MCP Tools in Rigging

Use the `rigging.mcp` function, specifying the transport method (`stdio` or `sse`) and the connection parameters. It returns an *async context manager*.

<CodeGroup>
```python Using "stdio" (Standard Input/Output)
import rigging as rg

# Connect to an MCP server launched as a local process that communicates over standard input/output.
# (Assuming 'my-mcp-server' is an executable that starts the MCP server)

command = "my-mcp-server"
args = ["--port", "stdio"] # Example arguments

async with rg.mcp("stdio", command=command, args=args) as mcp_client:
    # mcp_client.tools contains the list of tools discovered from the server
    print(f"Discovered {len(mcp_client.tools)} MCP tools via stdio.")

    if mcp_client.tools:
        chat = (
            await rg.get_generator("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
            .chat("Use the MCP tool Y.") # Adjust prompt based on available tools
            .using(*mcp_client.tools)
            .run()
        )
        print(chat.conversation)
    else:
        print("No MCP tools found.")

```

```python Using "sse" (Server-Sent Events)
import rigging as rg

# Connect to an MCP server exposed via an HTTP endpoint using Server-Sent Events.

# URL of the MCP SSE endpoint
MCP_SSE_URL = "http://localhost:8001/mcp" # Example URL

async with rg.mcp("sse", url=MCP_SSE_URL) as mcp_client:
    # mcp_client.tools contains the list of tools discovered from the server
    print(f"Discovered {len(mcp_client.tools)} MCP tools via SSE.")

    if mcp_client.tools:
        chat = (
            await rg.get_generator("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
            .chat("Use the MCP tool Z.") # Adjust prompt based on available tools
            .using(*mcp_client.tools)
            .run()
        )
        print(chat.conversation)
    else:
        print("No MCP tools found.")
```
</CodeGroup>

The `mcp` context manager handles the connection, tool discovery, and communication with the MCP server. Inside the `async with` block, `mcp_client.tools` provides the list of discovered `Tool` objects ready to be used with `.using()`.

#### Example: Using Claude Code as a Rigging Tool

```python
import rigging as rg

async with rg.mcp("stdio", command="claude", args=["mcp", "serve"]) as mcp_client:
    print(f"Discovered {len(mcp_client.tools)} tools:")
    for tool in mcp_client.tools:
        print(f" |- {tool.name}")

    chat = (
        await rg.get_generator("claude-3-7-sonnet-latest")
        .chat("Using tools, create a file_writer.py rigging tool that writes to a file.")
        .using(*mcp_client.tools)
        .run()
    )
    print(chat.conversation)
```

### Serving Tools with MCP

In addition to consuming tools from mcp servers, Rigging can **expose its own tools** as an MCP server. This allows you to write a singular tool implementation with the freedom to use it in other MCP-compliant clients, such as claude code.

The `rigging.as_mcp` function is the primary way to create an MCP server from your tools. It takes a list of Rigging `Tool` objects (or raw Python functions) and returns a `mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP` server instance, which you can then configure and run.

**How it works:**
1.  You provide a list of tools to `as_mcp`.
2.  It automatically converts raw functions into `rigging.Tool` objects.
3.  For each tool, it creates a bridge that handles:
    - Exposing the tool's name, description, and parameter schema.
    - Calling your Python function when a request comes in.
    - Converting your function's return value (including `rigging.Message` and `rigging.Stop`) into a format the MCP client can understand.
4.  It returns a `FastMCP` server instance, ready to be run.

Let's create a server that exposes a `file_writer` tool.

**1. Define your tool(s) in a file (e.g., `file_writer.py`):**

```python
import rigging as rg
from typing import Annotated

@rg.tool()
def write_file(
    filename: Annotated[str, "The name of the file to write to."],
    content: Annotated[str, "The content to write to the file."],
) -> str:
    """
    Writes content to a local file.
    Creates the file if it doesn't exist, and overwrites it if it does.
    """
    with open(filename, "w") as f:
        f.write(content)
    return f"Successfully wrote {len(content)} bytes to {filename}."

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create the MCP server instance from a list of tools
    rg.as_mcp([write_file], name="File IO Tools").run()
```

Now, this server is ready to be used by any MCP client:

- [claude-code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp)
- [gemini-cli](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/blob/main/docs/tools/mcp-server.md)
- [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/config.md#mcp_servers)

**Claude Code Example:**

```bash
$ claude mcp add file_writer -- uv run --with rigging --no-project file_writer.py
Added stdio MCP server file_writer with command: uv run --with rigging --no-project file_writer.py to local config

$ claude
> /mcp

## Robopages

[Robopages](https://github.com/dreadnode/robopages) is a framework for building and hosting tool-enabled "pages" or APIs. Rigging can dynamically fetch the available tools from a running Robopages server and make them available to your language model.

Use the `rigging.robopages` function to connect to a Robopages endpoint and retrieve its tools.

```python
import rigging as rg

# URL of your running Robopages server
ROBOPAGES_URL = "http://localhost:8080" # Example URL

try:
    # Fetch tools from the server
    robopages_tools = rg.robopages(ROBOPAGES_URL)

    # Use the fetched tools in a pipeline
    chat = (
        await rg.get_generator("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
        .chat("Use the available Robopages tool to do X.") # Adjust prompt based on available tools
        .using(*robopages_tools) # Unpack the list of tools
        .run()
    )
    print(chat.conversation)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to connect to Robopages or use tools: {e}")
    # Handle connection errors or cases where no tools are found
```

This fetches the tool definitions (name, description, parameters) from the Robopages server. When the language model requests one of these tools, Rigging sends the request back to the Robopages server for execution.

## Tool Execution Flow

When you call `.using()`:

1.  Rigging prepares the tool definitions based on the selected `mode`.
2.  For `api` mode, the definitions (`ApiToolDefinition`) are passed to the model provider's API.
3.  For `xml` or `json-in-xml` modes, Rigging injects the tool schemas and usage instructions into the system prompt.
4.  During generation, if the model decides to call a tool:
    *   In `api` mode, the provider returns structured tool call information (`ApiToolCall`).
    *   In native modes, Rigging parses the model's output for the expected XML format (`XmlToolCall` or `JsonInXmlToolCall`).
5.  Rigging validates the arguments provided by the model against the tool's signature using Pydantic.
6.  Your original Python function/method (or the relevant MCP/Robopages call) is executed with the validated arguments.
7.  The return value is formatted into a message (`Message` with `role="tool` for API calls, or a user message containing `NativeToolResult` for native calls) and sent back to the model.
8.  The generation process continues until the model produces a final response without tool calls or the `max_depth` is reached.

## Error Handling

Tools have built-in error handling that primarily focuses on **argument validation** and **JSON parsing errors** that occur during tool execution. Understanding how this works is crucial for building robust tool-enabled pipelines.

### Default Error Handling

By default, tools catch common errors that occur during the tool call process:

- **`json.JSONDecodeError`**: When the model provides malformed JSON arguments
- **`ValidationError`**: When the model's arguments don't match the tool's type signature

```python
import rigging as rg

@rg.tool()  # Default: catch={json.JSONDecodeError, ValidationError}
async def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Adds two numbers together."""
    return a + b

# If the model calls add({"a": 1}) without 'b', a ValidationError occurs
# The tool catches it and returns an error message to the model
pipeline = (
    rg.get_generator("openai/gpt-4o-mini")
    .chat("Use the add tool with only argument 'a' set to 1, no 'b'")
    .using(add)
)

chat = await pipeline.run()
# The model receives: "<error>1 validation error for call[add]..."
# And can respond acknowledging the error or retry with correct arguments
```

**Key Point**: These validation errors are handled **at the tool level** and become part of the conversation flow. The model receives error feedback and can learn from it, but the pipeline continues running.

### Customizing Error Handling

You can override the default error handling behavior:

```python
# Catch all exceptions (including your own function errors)
@rg.tool(catch=True)
def risky_tool(input: str) -> str:
    if input == "fail":
        raise ValueError("Something went wrong!")
    return "Success"

# Catch only specific exceptions
@rg.tool(catch={ValueError, TypeError})
def selective_tool(input: str) -> str:
    # Only ValueError and TypeError will be caught and returned as error messages
    return process_input(input)

# Catch no exceptions (let them propagate to pipeline level)
@rg.tool(catch=False)
def strict_tool(input: str) -> str:
    # Any errors will stop the pipeline unless caught by pipeline.catch()
    return process_input(input)
```

### Error Information and Debugging

When tools handle errors gracefully, error information is preserved in message metadata:

```python
chat = await pipeline.run()

# Check for tool errors in the conversation
for message in chat.all:
    if message.role == 'tool' and 'error' in message.metadata:
        print(f"Tool call failed: {message.metadata['error']}")
        print(f"Tool response: {message.content}")
```

## Tool State

Since tools defined with `@tool_method` operate on class instances, they can maintain and modify state across multiple calls within a single pipeline execution.

```python
class CounterTool:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    @rg.tool_method
    def increment(self, amount: int = 1) -> str:
        """Increments the counter and returns the new value."""
        self.count += amount
        return f"Counter is now {self.count}"

# Usage
counter = CounterTool()

chat = (
   await
   rg.get_generator(...)
   .chat("Increment twice")
   .using(counter.increment)
   .run()
)
```

You could also do the same thing by returning a stateful tool function defined in a closure:

```python
def counter_tool():
    count = 0

    @rg.tool
    def increment(amount: int = 1) -> str:
        nonlocal count
        count += amount
        return f"Counter is now {count}"

    return increment

# Usage
counter = counter_tool()

chat = (
   await
   rg.get_generator(...)
   .chat("Increment twice")
   .using(counter.increment)
   .run()
)
```
