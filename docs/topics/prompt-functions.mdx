Defining chat interactions as python functions is a great abstraction on top of chat pipelines, allowing you to leverage parsing logic and type hints to define a code-less function that will use a generator/pipeline underneath to produce an output.

A `Prompt` is typically created using one of the following decorators:

- `@rg.prompt` - Optionally takes a generator id, generator, or pipeline.
- `@generator.prompt` - Use this generator when executing the prompt.
- `@pipeline.prompt` - Use this pipeline when executing the prompt.

<Note>
Prompt functions can be defined with or without the `async` keyword, but they will always be represented as async calls once wrapped based on their connection to chat pipelines.

In other words, wrapping a synchronous function with `@rg.prompt` will result in an async callable.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```python Generator id
import rigging as rg

@rg.prompt(generator_id="mistral/mistral-medium-latest")
def summarize(text: str) -> str:
    """Summarize this text."""

```

```python Generator instance
import rigging as rg

generator = rg.get_generator("mistral/mistral-medium-latest")

@generator.prompt
def summarize(text: str) -> str:
    """Summarize this text."""

```

```python Chat Pipeline
import rigging as rg

pipeline = (
    rg.get_pipeline("mistral/mistral-medium-latest")
    .chat([
        {"role": "system", "content": "Respond like a pirate."}
    ])
)

@pipeline.prompt
def summarize(text: str) -> str:
    """Summarize this text."""

```

```python Unbound
import rigging as rg

@rg.prompt
def summarize(text: str) -> str:
    """Summarize this text."""

```
</CodeGroup>

Prompts are optionally bound to a pipeline/generator underneath, hence the generator and pipeline decorator variants, but they don't have to be. We refer to bound prompts as "standalone", because they can be executed directly as functions. Otherwise, you are required first "bind" the prompt to a specific generator id, generator, or pipeline to make it callable. Do this with  `Prompt.bind` or related methods.

```python
import rigging as rg

@rg.prompt
def summarize(text: str) -> str:
    """Summarize this text."""

generator = rg.get_generator("gpt-4o-mini")

await summarize.bind(generator)("...")
```

### Templates and Docstrings

Underneath, the function signature will be analyzed for inputs and outputs, and the docstring
will be used to create a final jinja2 template which will be used as the prompt text. You can
always access this `.template` attribute to inspect how the prompt
will be formatted.

Here are the general processing docstring rules:

- Any docstring content will always be at the top of the prompt.
- If no docstring is provided, a generic one will be substituted.
- Any inputs not explicitly defined in the docstring will be appended after the docstring.


<CodeGroup>
```python No docstring
import rigging as rg

@rg.prompt
def summarize(text: str) -> str:
    ...

print(summarize.template)

# Convert the following inputs to outputs (summarize).
#
# {{ text }}
#
# Produce the following output:
#
# <str></str>
```

```python Basic docstring
import rigging as rg

@rg.prompt
def summarize(text: str) -> str:
    """Summarize this text."""

print(summarize.template)

# Summarize this text.
#
# {{ text }}
#
# Produce the following output:
#
# <str></str>
```

```python Inputs in docstring
import rigging as rg

@rg.prompt
def summarize(text: str) -> str:
    """
    Summarize the following:

    {{ text }}

    Be concise.
    """

print(summarize.template)

# Summarize the following:
#
# {{ text }}
#
# Be concise.
#
# Produce the following output:
#
# <str></str>
```
</CodeGroup>

In other words, you can define how inputs will be included in the prompt by passing them inside the docstring in jinja2 formats, or let Rigging handle this for you by omitting them.

### Outputs and Context

In the example above, you'll notice that defining our function to output a `str` results in the following text be appended to the prompt template:

```python No docstring
# Produce the following output:
#
# <str></str>
```

This is pretty light on context, and we can improve this by updating our signature with a `Ctx` annotation:

```python
from typing import Annotated
import rigging as rg

Summary = Annotated[str, rg.Ctx(tag="summary", example="[2-3 sentences]")]

@rg.prompt
def summarize(text: Annotated[str, rg.Ctx(tag="long-text")]) -> Summary:
    """Summarize this text."""

print(summarize.template)

# Summarize this text.
#
# {{ long_text }}
#
# Produce the following output:
#
# <summary>[2-3 sentences]</summary>
```

We can apply `Ctx` annotations to any of the inputs and outputs of a prompt. We can override the xml tag, provide an example, and add prefix text.

Output processing is optional, and can be omitted by returning a `Chat` object from the wrapped function. This allows you to do with the generated output as you please.

```python
import rigging as rg

@rg.prompt
def summarize(text: str) -> rg.Chat:
    """Summarize this text."""

print(summarize.template)

# Summarize this text.
#
# {{ text }}
```

### Complex Outputs

You can also define more complex outputs by using a rigging model, list, tuple, or dataclass. Not every construction will be supported, and we attempt to pre-validate the output structure to ensure it can be processed correctly.

<CodeGroup>
```python Model
import rigging as rg

class User(rg.Model):
    name: str
    email: str
    age: int

@rg.prompt
def generate_user() -> User:
    """Generate a fake test user."""

print(generate_user.template)

# Generate a fake test user.
#
# Produce the following output:
#
# <user>
#   <name/>
#   <email/>
#   <age/>
# </user>
```

```python List of models
import rigging as rg

class User(rg.Model):
    name: str
    email: str
    age: int

@rg.prompt
def generate_users(count: int = 3) -> list[User]:
    """Generate fake test users."""

print(generate_users.template)

# Generate fake test users.
#
# {{ count }}
#
# Produce the following output for each item:
#
# <user>
#   <name/>
#   <email/>
#   <age/>
# </user>
```

```python Dataclass
from dataclasses import dataclass
import rigging as rg

@dataclass
class User:
    name: str
    email: str
    age: int

@rg.prompt
def generate_user() -> User:
    """Generate a fake test user."""

print(generate_user.template)

# Generate a fake test user.
#
# Produce the following outputs:
#
# <name></name>
#
# <email></email>
#
# <age></age>
```

```python Tuple
import rigging as rg

name = Annotated[str, rg.Ctx(tag="name")]
email = Annotated[str, rg.Ctx(tag="email")]
age = Annotated[int, rg.Ctx(tag="age")]

@rg.prompt
def generate_user() -> tuple[name, email, age]:
    """Generate a fake test user."""

print(generate_user.template)

# Generate a fake test user.
#
# Produce the following outputs:
#
# <name></name>
#
# <email></email>
#
# <age></age>
```
</CodeGroup>

You can also embed a `Chat` object inside other objects, which will be excluded from any prompt guidance, but supplied the value when the prompt is executed. This is great for gathering both structured data and the original chat.

<CodeGroup>
```python Chat in Tuple
import rigging as rg

joke = Annotated[str, rg.Ctx(tag="joke")]

@rg.prompt
def tell_joke() -> tuple[joke, rg.Chat]:
    """Tell a joke."""

print(tell_joke.template)

# Tell a joke.
#
# Produce the following output:
#
# <joke></joke>
```

```python Chat in Dataclass
from dataclasses import dataclass
import rigging as rg

@dataclass
class Joke:
    setup: str
    punchline: str
    chat: rg.Chat

@rg.prompt
def tell_joke() -> Joke:
    """Tell a joke."""

print(tell_joke.template)

# Tell a joke.
#
# Produce the following outputs:
#
# <setup></setup>
#
# <punchline></punchline>
```
</CodeGroup>

## Rendering Prompts

In addition to templates, you can use `.render` with valid inputs to view the exact prompt as it will be sent to a generator. You can also use this to pass your prompt into pipelines at your discretion.

```python
from typing import Annotated
import rigging as rg

email = Annotated[str, rg.Ctx(tag="email")]

@rg.prompt
def convert_to_email(name: str, top: int = 5) -> list[email]:
    """Convert this name into the best {{ top }} email addresses."""

print(convert_to_email.render("John Doe"))

# Convert this name into the best 5 email addresses.
#
# <name>John Doe</name>
#
# Produce the following output for each item:
#
# <email></email>
```

## Running Prompts

Prompt objects expose the following methods for execution:

- `Prompt.run()` (Aliased with `__call__`)
- `Prompt.run_many()`
- `Prompt.run_over()`

*(Available if the prompt was supplied/bonded to a pipeline or generator)*

You can also bind a prompt at runtime with any of the following:

- `Prompt.bind()`
- `Prompt.bind_many()`
- `Prompt.bind_over()`

<Note>
Everything configured on a pipeline or generator will be used when running the prompt. Watch/Then/Map callbacks, tools, and generate params can all be used to alter the behavior of the prompt.

In general, you should consider prompts as producers of user messages, which will be passed to `.fork()`, then handle the parsing of outputs.

import rigging as rg

@rg.prompt(generator_id="claude-3-sonnet-20240229")
def write_code(description: str, language: str = "python") -> str:

code = await write_code("Calculate the factorial of a number.")
```
